 College life is an important aspect of every student's life
 and it comes with its own set of adventures.
 Staying away from home is a matter of fun
 and enjoyment but the enjoyment and good time
 spent in college times are only limited
 till the time you graduate. The highs and
 lows that you go through in your life
 and all the entertaining blunders that you
 will look back on will,in some way or the 
 other contribute towards making you a wiser person.

  <h2><b>Expectation</b></h2>
  We thought the campus size to be bigger
  It has everything from sports ground to academics.
  A lot of parks and garden inside the campus.
  <h2><b>Reality</b></h2>
  But after we came in the college on the day
  of reporting we came to know that the campus
  size is too small.There were just 2 hostel
  buildings and one academic building.Rest of the 
  buildings is for JUT students.Also the campus
  can accomodate just first year students only.
  The remaining year students have to stay on
  jupmi campus.The sports side of our college
  is also very dissapointing.The college dosen't
  have its basketball court.the cricket ground
  is also short in size.Overall we have to manage 
  anyway.

    <h2><b>Expectation </b></h2> 
  We expect that every kind of meal with
  no good quality and taste will be given to us.
  the foods will be not hygenic.we have to order the meal
  online many times to fill our stomach
  <h2><b>Reality </b></h2>
  
  The meal given to us is of very good quality.
  It's taste is very nice.Even both veg and non veg is
  given to us which is rarely given in any other college.
  only the snacks part is not much good.Otherwise the meal
  is good in dinner,breakfast and lunch.
  the seating capacity of mess is little bit small.

  <h2><font color="blue"><i><i>Expectation</i></i></font></h2><font color="blue"><i> 
  We expected a separate building for indoor games,
  large ground for outdoor games and a gym
  with all those equipment provided to a sportplayer. 
  <h2><i>Reality</i></h2> 
  There is a lack of sports field in our college.
  Only badminton and volleyball field is there.
  Rest of the sports field is not well defined.
  Also the college dosen't yet provided any sports equipment.

    <h2><i>Expectation</i></h2>  
             
 We expected a 24/7 power supply and
 super powerful generator thats just starts
 working after a power cut. thereshould be no
 electricity shortage. 
   <h2><i>Reality</i></h2> 
 There is a power cut at a regular interval of
 time which creates a lot of problem to us
 specially for studying.Also the generator has
 never operated after a power cut.
 we have to wait for electricity to come.

      <h2><i>Expectations</i></h2>
 we have expected that we would get a strong wifi
 connection with downloading speed of more than
 1 gbps.Thus, we can download huge games and
 movies in just a second. 
   <h2><i>Reality</i></h2> 
 Thers is a jio wifi installed in every floor
 which is shared among the 8 students.We get a
 downloading speed of approx 5 mbps which is 
 very low and it takes a lot of time to download
 any file.
